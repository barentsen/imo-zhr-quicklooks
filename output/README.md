This directory contains the ZHR Quicklook graphs created by Geert Barentsen
for various meteor showers between 2006 and 2016, and made available
on the website of the International Meteor Organization.

Graphs were only created when sufficient data was available for an automated
quicklook. For this reason, some showers do not have ZHR graphs for certain years when e.g. they coincided with a Full Moon.
